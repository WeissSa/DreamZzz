This is the repo for a game I worked on for a highschool project called DreamZzz. 
Although I initially intended to make a complete game, it quickly became too big of a project for the amount of time given.
As of right now I have decided to stop working on this project in order to allow me to pursue new interests. In the files here you will find code I worked on over the course of
around a year. Over this year I learned a lot about project management and file organization, but there is definitely some spaghetti code in this project.

I would not say the current code here is represenative of my current skill. But I did learn a lot!

If you have any questions don't hesitate to reach out.
